# Recurrence Analysis

The files in this repository can be used to perform recurrence analysis of time series in MATLAB. With them you can generate the distance matrix (DM) and the recurrence plot (RP). Soon, you will also be able to carry out recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and recurrence network analysis (RNA).

## 1. Distance Matrix (DM)

## 2. Recurrence Plot (RP)

Here are some examples of recurrence plots. See how beautiful and informative these binary matrices can be!

### Stochastic process

**Figure 1** _Recurrence plot of a sequence drawn from the uniform distribution_ x(t) \~ U(0,1)_. In this example, embedding dimension = 1 and threshold = 0.2._

### Sinusoidal function
